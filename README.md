# App-Design-First-Project
A project done as a first project for our 4th year 'Application Design' course as a part of our UX Design track.

## Chosen Design
Design 5, the plant "encyclopedia" I guess

## Chosen Technology and why
I chose to work on Android with **Compose** because:
- Objectively:
  - More efficient even though it is more recent & incomplete
- Subjectively:
  - Easier to understand and to read
  - More documentation available

## Bonus Features
In progress:
- Showing other types of plants when changing the selection in the navbar
- Giving each plant its own page with more detailed info

## Challenges Encountered
- Importing custom fonts
- Overflow of the pictures within Box elements
- Navigating to other pages with *NavHost*
